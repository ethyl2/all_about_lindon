# All About Lindon, UT

https://ethyl2.github.io/all_about_lindon

This project displays some of my favorite locations in Lindon, Utah.
It displays a map from the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/),
 along with information about the locations obtained from
 the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/).
A window also displays panorama images from the Google Maps Street View Service.
